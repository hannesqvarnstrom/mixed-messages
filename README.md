# mixed-messages

Codecademy Portfolio Project
The purpose of this project is to create a script that returns a randomized message in a certain subject.
I have chosen random jokes. This could not be possible without 15Dkatz open API => **https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api**
A HTML-page is included to test this script.

## How to use

You open a html-page by dragging it into your browser or by double-clicking it.
Click the _New joke_ button to get a new joke!
It should generate you a message. Have fun trying it out!
