# mixed-messages
Codecademy Portfolio Project
The purpose of this project is to create a script that returns a randomized message in a certain subject. 
A HTML-page is included to test this script, but it is not needed to test it.

## How to use 
First, locate the folder where you have the script.
Move to this folder in your chosen CLI. (command line interface, like Bash, Git-Bash, Powershell etc)
Make sure you have Node.js installed by inputting this command:
```
node -v
``` 
If there's a version, it should be sufficient. 
Then, input this command to test the script.
```
node script.js
```
It should generate you a message. Have fun trying it out!
